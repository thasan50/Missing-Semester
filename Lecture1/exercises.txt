1. echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
2. cd /tmp; mkdir missing
3. touch - creates a new file
4. touch semester
5. echo '#!/bin/sh' > semester
echo 'curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu' >> semester
6. ./semester doesn't work because user doesn't have execute permission
7. sh works because you're forcing the shell to read the file as plain text and directly interpret it. 
8. Chmod changes the permissions of a file or directory
9. chmod u+x semester gives the user executable permissions. 
./semester works because we have the shebang line telling bash to use that specific interpreter.
10. ./semester | grep "last-modified:" | sed 's/last-modified: *//' > last-modified.txt
11. cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/capacity
